# SingleQubitGates
Simple qubit gates using the Qiskit library, written as python files and in Jupyter Notebook format

Contains
  - Pauli X, Y, and Z gates
  - Rx, Ry, Rz Rotation gates
  - S, T, S Dagger, and T Dagger gates

Ways this repo can be improved
  - Documentation could be expanded, might do so in the future.
  - Exploring deeper in the visualization library built into qiskit
